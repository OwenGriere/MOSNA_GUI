///
/// A parquet file is written from front to back and is unreadable until its
/// footer lands, so anything that reads it while it is being written gets
/// `ParquetError("External: end of file")`. That is not hypothetical for the
/// nodes files: step 3 writes its niche labels back into them, and a second
/// analysis — or the interface's network view — may be reading the very same
/// file at that moment.
///
/// Writing beside the target and renaming over it closes the window. `rename`
/// is atomic within a filesystem, so a reader sees either the whole previous
/// file or the whole new one, never the seam between them.
///
/// This does not make concurrent *writers* safe: two runs that both read a file
/// and both rename their own version over it still lose one of the two changes.
/// That is what the caller's lock is for.

/// only re-clusters reads the aggregation and the projection of every other, so
/// one run can be writing the file another is reading — and a parquet is
/// unreadable until its footer lands.

/// Arrow keeps its own entry in this map; the pairs given here are added
/// alongside it and do not disturb any other reader, which is the point of
/// putting them there rather than in a file of their own.

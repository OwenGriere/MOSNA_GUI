//! work is then done, and one that stayed open would cover the value it had
//! just set — and wrong for every menu where several are ticked: choosing four
//! phenotypes meant opening the menu four times.
//!
//! The distinction cannot be checked by drawing a frame, so it is checked at
//! the source: a menu that ticks several things goes through
//! `panels::multi_select`, which is the one place the behaviour is stated.

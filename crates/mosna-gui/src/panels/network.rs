//! The interactive network — the Viewer's Network tab.
//!
//! The arithmetic is all in [`crate::model::network`]; what is left here is the
//! drawing, the input, and the decision of when the prepared geometry has gone
//! stale.
//!
//! # How it stays fast
//!
//! A sample is tens to hundreds of thousands of cells, and egui copies every
//! vertex it is given into the frame's primitives. Two things keep that
//! bounded. The geometry is *prepared* — cell centres and edge endpoints in
//! mesh space, with their colours resolved — for a region half a screen wider
//! than the view, and re-used until the view leaves it, so panning does not
//! re-read a column or re-run the colour map. And the prepared set is capped:
//! past [`crate::model::network::CELL_BUDGET`] cells only every `stride`-th is
//! kept, which at that
//! zoom is the same picture because the cells are sub-pixel and overlapping.
//!
//! What is rebuilt every frame is the mesh itself, from the prepared centres
//! and the camera. That is a multiply and an add per vertex, and it is what
//! lets a cell keep the same size on screen at every zoom without the geometry
//! depending on the zoom.

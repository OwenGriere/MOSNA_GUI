//! The brushed gold of the progress bar.
//!
//! A bar that only grows says how far along a step is. It does not say whether
//! anything is still happening — and the steps here spend minutes between two
//! increments, on a cohort of two hundred samples. So the fill is a piece of
//! metal rather than a coloured rectangle: a gold ramp carrying a fixed grain,
//! with a single wide reflection travelling slowly across it. The position is
//! the progress, the light passing is the pulse. Stop the process and the light
//! stops with it; the metal stays.
//!
//! What this replaced was three highlights sliding along the bar on a cycle of
//! under two seconds. It read as a flux — something pouring through the bar —
//! rather than as work being done, because a pattern that repeats along its own
//! length and comes round again that quickly is a pattern, and the eye follows
//! patterns. Here nothing repeats along the bar: the grain does not move, and
//! there is only ever one reflection.
//!
//! All of it is arithmetic on a clock, which is why it lives here rather than
//! in the panel that paints it: a reflection that flickers, jumps at the seam of
//! its cycle or leaves the palette is a bug, and none of those can be seen in a
//! screenshot.

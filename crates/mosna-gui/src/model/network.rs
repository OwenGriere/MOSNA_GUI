//! The interactive network view: its data, and the arithmetic behind it.
//!
//! Everything here is pure — loading a sample, deciding what a column means,
//! building the legend, finding the cell under the pointer, moving the camera,
//! choosing how much detail to draw. The panel that draws it holds no
//! arithmetic of its own, so all of this is testable without a window.
//!
//! # Why a model at all
//!
//! The static figures the pipeline writes answer "what does this sample look
//! like". They cannot answer "what is *that* cell", which is the question a
//! biologist actually has in front of a network. That question needs the
//! attributes to stay attached to the coordinates, and needs them at the
//! pointer — so the data has to live in the interface, not in a PNG.
